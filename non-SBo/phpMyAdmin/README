phpMyAdmin is intended to handle the adminstration of MySQL
over the web. Currently it can: create and drop databases,
create, copy, drop and alter tables, delete, edit and add
fields, execute any SQL-statement, even batch-queries, manage
keys on fields, load text files into tables, create and read
dumps of tables, export data to CSV value, administer multiple
servers and single databases.

Per default phpMyAdmin will be configured with Cookie-Authentification
enabled. This will require a Blowfish-seed set for the encryption
of username/password in the cookie. The default seed can be changed
by passing BLOWFISH_SEED=newSeed to the build-script.
You can also change the authentification method to config by passing
AUTH_CONFIG=yes to the script. That way user/password lines are added
to the config-file, which you will need to change to match the user
of your mysql-database. The relevant lines are:
  $cfg['Servers'][$i]['user'] = 'dbuser';
  $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = 'dbpasswd';
where dbuser/dbpasswd should be replaced with your user-information.

After installing the package you need to run 'pma-config'. That script
will generate a symlink in your DocumentRoot to the install-directory
of phpMyAdmin. You will need to run that script whenever you change
the DocumentRoot of your Webserver.

You can start phpMyAdmin by going to http://localhost/phpMyAdmin
or by executing /usr/bin/phpMyAdmin, which is a script that checks
for the environment variable $BROWSER (not set in Slackware per default)
or, if that one is empty, the availability of installed browsers and
starts phpMyAdmin in the specified browser. You can also do something like
  BROWSER=firefox phpMyAdmin
to force the use of a given browser.

phpMyAdmin requires a running apache-server with mod_php enabled.
