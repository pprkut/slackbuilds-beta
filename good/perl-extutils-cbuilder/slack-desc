# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

perl-extutils-cbuilder:
perl-extutils-cbuilder: This module can build the C portions of Perl modules by invoking the
perl-extutils-cbuilder: appropriate compilers and linkers in a cross-platform manner.
perl-extutils-cbuilder: It was motivated by the `Module::Build' project, but may be useful
perl-extutils-cbuilder: for other purposes as well. However, it is *not* intended as a
perl-extutils-cbuilder: general cross-platform interface to all your C building needs.
