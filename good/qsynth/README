Qsynth is a fluidsynth GUI front-end application, written in
C++ around the Qt4 toolkit, using Qt Designer. Eventually it
may evolve into a softsynth management application allowing
the user to control and manage a variety of command line
softsynths.

Requires fluidsynth, also available from SlackBuilds.org.
