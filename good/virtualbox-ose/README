VirtualBox Open Source Edition (OSE) is a general-purpose full
virtualizer for x86 hardware.

You'll probably want to add the following lines to your rc.local:
	# Start vboxdrv
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.vboxdrv ]; then
	  /etc/rc.d/rc.vboxdrv start
	fi

This will load the support kernel module for VirtualBox. You should add
similar "stop" lines to your rc.local_shutdown.

By default you have to create a vboxusers group, for example with
	groupadd -g 215 vboxusers
and make your user a member of that group.
Alternatively, you can run the script with VBOXUSERS=no to allow all
users of your system to start virtual machines.

By default VirtualBox will be compiled with hardening enabled. That
means all binaries will be run suid root, which is the default
behaviour of upstream packages. However, you are still able
to disable this by passing HARDENING=no to the script.
When hardening is enabled, VBOXUSERS is automatically set to yes.

If the VirtualBox Additions ISO is available in the same directory
as the build script, it will be included in the package and placed
under /usr/share/virtualbox/. Same goes for the UserManual
They can be downloaded from:
	http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/2.2.2/VBoxGuestAdditions_2.2.2.iso
	http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/2.2.2/UserManual.pdf

To compile virtualbox without GUI pass QT4=no to the script.

To enable the webservice pass WEBSERVICE=yes to the script. This adds gsoap
to the list of required dependencies.

For pulseaudio support, pass PULSE=yes to the build script. This requires
pulseaudio to be installed.

This requires acpica, and the virtualbox-kernel package is needed at runtime.

All mentioned dependencies are available from SlackBuilds.org
