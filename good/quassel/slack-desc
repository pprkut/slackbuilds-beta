# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

quassel:
quassel: Quassel IRC is a modern, cross-platform, distributed IRC client,
quassel: meaning that one (or multiple) client(s) can attach to and detach
quassel: from a central core -- much like the popular combination of screen
quassel: and a text-based IRC client such as WeeChat, but graphical. In
quassel: addition to this uniqe feature, we aim to bring a pleasurable,
quassel: comfortable chatting experience to all major platforms.
