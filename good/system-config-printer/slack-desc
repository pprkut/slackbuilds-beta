# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

system-config-printer: using pygtk for the graphical parts and with some Python bindings
system-config-printer: (pycups) for the CUPS API. It is largely the same as using the CUPS
system-config-printer: web interface for configuring printers, but has the advantage of
