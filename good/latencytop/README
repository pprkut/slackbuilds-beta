LatencyTOP is a Linux* tool for software developers (both
kernel and userspace), aimed at identifying where in the
system latency is happening, and what kind of operation/action
is causing the latency to happen so that the code can be
changed to avoid the worst latency hiccups.

This requires a custom kernel with CONFIG_LATENCYTOP=y
