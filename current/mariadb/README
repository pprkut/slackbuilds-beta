MariaDB is a backward compatible, drop-in replacement branch of the
MySQL(R) Database Server. It includes all major open source storage
engines, including the Maria storage engine.

This conflicts with Slackware's mysql package. Do NOT install both!

If you want to build the embedded mysql server (libmysqld), pass
EMBEDDED=yes to the script. Note that you need that if you plan
on (re)building amarok.

WARNING: This does NOT have the innodb engine enabled by default.
Here's what you have to do *after* installing the package:

 -) comment any innodb specific options in /etc/my.cnf (innodb_*),
    otherwise the database server won't start

 -) start the database server and login (as a user who has priviledges
    to edit the mysql.* tables)

 -) uncomment the previously commented options in /etc/my.cnf again.
    Do NOT restart the database server!!

 -) execute the following query:
        INSTALL PLUGIN innodb SONAME "ha_innodb.so";
    This reloads the database server and comfigures it to load the
    innodb plugin on every start.

 -) Now everything should be working again as expected
