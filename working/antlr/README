ANTLR, (AN)other (T)ool for (L)anguage (R)ecognition - formerly known
as PCCTS - is a language tool that provides a framework for
constructing recognizers, compilers, and translators from grammatical
descriptions containing actions in Java, C++, C# or Python.

If you want support for C#, you need mono.
