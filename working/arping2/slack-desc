# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

arping2:
arping2: Arping is a util to find out it a specific IP address on the LAN is
arping2: 'taken' and what MAC address owns it. Sure, you *could* just use
arping2: 'ping' to find out if it's taken and even if the computer blocks
arping2: ping (and everything else) you still get an entry in your ARP cache.
arping2: But what if you aren't on a routable net? Or the host blocks ping
arping2: (all ICMP even)? Then you're screwed. Or you use arping.
