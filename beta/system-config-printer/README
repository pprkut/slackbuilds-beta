The purpose of the tool is to configure a CUPS server (often the local machine)
using the CUPS API. The tool is written in Python, using pygtk for the graphical
parts and with some Python bindings (pycups) for the CUPS API. It is largely
the same as using the CUPS web interface for configuring printers, but has the
advantage of being a native application rather than a web page.

system-config-printer depends on pycups and notify-python. Both are available
from SlackBuilds.org
