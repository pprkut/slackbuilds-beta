# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

system-config-printer:
system-config-printer: The purpose of the tool is to configure a CUPS server
system-config-printer: (often the local machine) using the CUPS API. The tool
system-config-printer: is written in Python, using pygtk for the graphical
system-config-printer: parts and with some Python bindings (pycups) for the
system-config-printer: CUPS API. It is largely the same as using the CUPS web
system-config-printer: interface for configuring printers, but has the
system-config-printer: advantage of being a native application rather than a
system-config-printer: web page.
