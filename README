This is a repository of my Work-In-Progress SlackBuilds. A lot of the scripts
available here will sooner or later find their way to SlackBuilds.org.
I consider most of the scripts here beta-quality, hence the name of the repository.
If you want stable, tested scripts head over to SlackBuilds.org.

The scripts are divided into multiple subdirectories, which reflect their current
state of development:
 - "not-working" contains script that will not build as is on the most recent Slackware
   version.

 - "working" contains scripts that are basically ok, but lack other points required to
   mark them stable, like missing documentation, conflicts with other scripts, lack
   of testing, etc

 - "good" contains the scripts I consider ready for submission to SlackBuilds.org.
   All of my scripts that are currently in pending or READY on SlackBuilds.org are
   available from here, but will disappear as soon as they are available from the
   public repository there.

 - "current" contains scripts that will only work on Slackware-current

 - "non-SBo" contains scripts that are for one or the other reason not acceptable
   on SlackBuilds.org. The quality of those scripts is on the same level as of
   those in "good"
